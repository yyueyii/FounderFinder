## Description
FounderFinder is a dating-app style application that offers a convenient and efficient way for users to find their start-up partners. Through this app, users can view the profile cards of other users and express interest in collaborating. When both users are interested in working with each other, a successful match is made and the users can communicate via our chat feature.

## Core Features
1. Comprehensive profile cards of users to better understand their sectoral focus/themselves as a person
2. Accept or reject the user upon viewing the profile card
3. Matching algorithm to filter profile cards according to the user’s preferences (sectors and skill)
4. Algorithm that recommends users that “liked” you (but you have not “liked” them yet)
5. Upon a successful match, a pop up alert appears and the user can choose to message immediately or later
6. Chat function to allow users to chat with one another to learn more about their aspirations
7. ‘Matches’ page that allows users to view and message the profiles that successfully matched with them
8. Profile settings that allows people to select their desired sector they are interested in, skills that they have and share more about themselves
9. Email verification for profile user to ensure legitimacy of user
